# Simple Web Shop Mockup

This repository contains a very small web shop prototype.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the mockup. You can either double click the file or open it via a `file://` URL. If you prefer running a local server, execute `python3 -m http.server` in this folder and browse to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Pushing to GitHub

This Codex environment cannot push changes to GitHub directly. To publish the repository yourself:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Add the GitHub repository as a remote, e.g. `git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL`.
3. Push the files with `git push -u origin main` (replace `main` if your branch is named differently).
